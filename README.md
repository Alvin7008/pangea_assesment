### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/

```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- Components/
|- model/
|- view/
|- view/screens
|- view/widgets

```


Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- Components - All the application level constants are defined in this directory with-in their respective files. This directory contains the constants for theme and List of Business Logics.
2- Model - Contains the model class for business logic.
3- View â€” This directory contains all the ui of your application. Each screen is located in the folder `Screen`. All the screen specific widgets will be placed in `widgets` directory.
